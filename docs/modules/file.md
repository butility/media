### File Management Module

This module provides a set of utilities for handling various file operations, including uploading, downloading, zipping, unzipping, and validating files. It also includes support for DEFLATE decompression and file size/type validation, making it a comprehensive tool for managing file-related tasks in web applications.

#### Namespace: `File`

The `File` namespace includes the following exported functions for file management:

---

### **Functions:**

#### **1. decompressDEFLATE(compressedData: ArrayBuffer): Promise<ArrayBuffer>**
- **Description**: Decompresses data using the DEFLATE algorithm.
- **Parameters**:
  - `compressedData` (ArrayBuffer, required): The compressed data to decompress.
- **Returns**: A `Promise` that resolves to the decompressed `ArrayBuffer`.

#### **2. downloadFile(fileUrl: string, fileName: string, fileType?: string): Promise<any>**
- **Description**: Downloads a file from the provided URL and triggers a download with the specified file name and optional file type.
- **Parameters**:
  - `fileUrl` (string, required): The URL of the file to download.
  - `fileName` (string, required): The name to give the downloaded file.
  - `fileType` (string, optional): The MIME type of the file to set for the download.
- **Returns**: A `Promise` that resolves when the file is downloaded.

#### **3. unzip(zipBlob: Blob): Promise<File[]>**
- **Description**: Unzips a `.zip` file and returns the contents as an array of `File` objects.
- **Parameters**:
  - `zipBlob` (Blob, required): The zipped file blob to unzip.
- **Returns**: A `Promise` that resolves to an array of `File` objects contained within the zip archive.

#### **4. uploadFile(file: File, url: string): Promise<any>**
- **Description**: Uploads a file to a specified server URL.
- **Parameters**:
  - `file` (File, required): The file to upload.
  - `url` (string, required): The URL to which the file will be uploaded.
- **Returns**: A `Promise` that resolves when the upload is complete.

#### **5. validateFileSize(file: File, maxSize: number): boolean**
- **Description**: Validates whether a file's size is within a specified maximum size limit.
- **Parameters**:
  - `file` (File, required): The file to validate.
  - `maxSize` (number, required): The maximum file size in bytes.
- **Returns**: `true` if the file size is valid, otherwise `false`.

#### **6. validateFileType(file: File, allowedTypes: string[], allowedExtensions: string[]): boolean**
- **Description**: Validates a file's MIME type and extension against a list of allowed types and extensions.
- **Parameters**:
  - `file` (File, required): The file to validate.
  - `allowedTypes` (string[], required): Array of allowed MIME types.
  - `allowedExtensions` (string[], required): Array of allowed file extensions.
- **Returns**: `true` if the file type and extension are valid, otherwise `false`.

#### **7. zip(files: File[], zipFileName: string): Promise<Blob>**
- **Description**: Compresses multiple files into a single `.zip` file.
- **Parameters**:
  - `files` (File[], required): An array of files to compress into the zip archive.
  - `zipFileName` (string, required): The name to give the resulting zip file.
- **Returns**: A `Promise` that resolves to a `Blob` representing the zip file.
